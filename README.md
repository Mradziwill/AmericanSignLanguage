# AmericanSignLanguage
School Project for introduction to Machine Learning subject. I was responsible for data collection and creating a model.
The model recognizes all letters except two which are done by moving a hand, hence they can't be by image classification.
For the classification of A, B and C All 3 models got 100% accuracy and it detects letters live very good.
When analyzing all of the letters we can observe that EfficientNet outperforms the rest by a lot.
